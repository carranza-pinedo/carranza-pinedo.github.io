## Bio

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Münster, Department of Philosophy, where I am member of the collaborative project "[The role of individual internal states in niche choice, niche construction, and behavioural niche conformance](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/biologie/forschung/verbuende/sfb_nc3/projects/d01ph2#comp_00005c3e9e38_00000000a7_0131)" led by Ulrich Krohs. 

I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Milan and the École Normale Supérieure de Paris. You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9jjklbz6yfjfqv83zljvs/cvitae_english.pdf?rlkey=59k2z9ubrn7c9hhyvh2rhl2ft&st=3uvrox11&dl=0).

My current research explores topics related to the empirical study of non-human minds and to the expressive aspects of communication.

In August, I will give a talk at the First Latino American Congress of Affective Sciences (Belo Horizonte, Brazil) titled "Rethinking Expressive Content: Meaning, Emotion, and Mirativity," and another talk at the Philosophy of Neutrality Conference (Neuchâtel, Switzerland) titled "Reevaluating Predicates of Personal Taste: The Case for Semantic Neutrality."
