## Bio

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Münster, Department of Philosophy, where I am member of the collaborative project "[The role of individual internal states in niche choice, niche construction, and behavioural niche conformance](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/biologie/forschung/verbuende/sfb_nc3/projects/d01ph2#comp_00005c3e9e38_00000000a7_0131)" led by [Ulrich Krohs](https://www.uni-muenster.de/PhilSem/mitglieder/krohs/krohs.html). 

My Ph.D. is from the Università degli Studi di Milano and the École Normale Supérieure (Institut Jean Nicod), where I was co-advised by [Elisa Paganini](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/elisa-paganini) and [Márta Abrusán](https://sites.google.com/site/martaabrusan/). Before that, I did my master in philosophy at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, co-advised by François Recanati and Michael Murez.

I am currently working on developing a new approach to the study of ape signaling behaviors, integrating methodologies from the philosophy of language, sociolinguistics, and behavioral biology. I am also interested in the semantics & pragmatics of expressive and evaluative terms, the study of animal cognition and affect, and the evolution of language.
