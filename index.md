## Bio

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Münster, where I am member of the collaborative project "[The role of individual internal states in niche choice, niche construction, and behavioural niche conformance](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/biologie/forschung/verbuende/sfb_nc3/projects/d01ph2#comp_00005c3e9e38_00000000a7_0131)" led by Ulrich Krohs. 

I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Milan and the École Normale Supérieure in 2022, under the supervision of Elisa Paganini and Márta Abrusán. You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9r5eqvgdkhf6zszw8spa6/cvitae_english.pdf?rlkey=wm5vkhlr7mu25lzm4lv9fq41x&st=6fygl02b&dl=0) and my dissertation [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04585871).

My current research explores topics related to animal minds, focusing on topics like:

+ the study of animal affect and wellbeing through cognitive bias tests.
+ the compatibility of sentience's multidimensional structure with inter-species welfare comparisons.
+ the relationship between niche construction processes and animal goal-directed decision-making.

Additionally, I work on foundational issues about emotions, such as the problem of recalcitrant emotions, and on the expression of emotions, e.g., through derogatory language.
