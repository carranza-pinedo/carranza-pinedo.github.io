I work in philosophy of language and philosophy of mind, with a focus on affective meaning (slurs, pejoratives, nicknames) and the science of affect (animal emotions, sentience, welfare). Until December 2025 I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Münster (Department of Philosophy) in the project [“The role of individual internal states in niche choice, niche construction, and behavioural niche conformance”](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/biologie/forschung/verbuende/sfb_nc3/projects/d01ph2) (PI: [Ulrich Krohs](https://www.uni-muenster.de/PhilSem/mitglieder/krohs/krohs.html)).

My Ph.D. is from the Università degli Studi di Milano and the École Normale Supérieure (Institut Jean Nicod), where I was co-advised by [Elisa Paganini](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/elisa-paganini) and [Márta Abrusán](https://sites.google.com/site/martaabrusan/). Before that, I did my master in philosophy at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, co-advised by François Recanati and Michael Murez.
